# Metal-Gear-Codec-Watchface
This is a watchface I created for Fitbit Smartwatches. It can run on the Ionic and all the Versa versions. 
You can find more informations about the watchface and it's functionality on my small blog: https://balpnuh.wordpress.com/2019/11/12/fitbit-versa-watchface/

If you find some bugs or problems in the code just let me know, I am willing to learn and improve.
