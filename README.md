# Metal-Gear-Codec-Watchface
This is a watchface I created for Fitbit Smartwatches. It can run on the Ionic and the Versa up until Version 2 (for Version 3 and the Sense I'll upload the code to a later point, but the main changes are other coordinates of the elements and some changes in the naming).

I did not upload the images yet cause I am not sure on the rights to share those because they are probably protected by Konami. I'll check this and also upload them to a later point if possible. In general you'll need a folder wiht the name images in resources and uplaod the images there.

You can find more informations about the watchface and it's functionality on my small blog: https://balpnuh.wordpress.com/2019/11/12/fitbit-versa-watchface/

If you find some bugs or problems in the code just let me know, I am willing to learn and improve. And I apologies for using qwuite a lot of german file and variable names. I'll try to avoid this in the future.
